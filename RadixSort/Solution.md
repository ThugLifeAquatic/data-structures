- What did you learn?
    -  I learned what a radix sort is and how to implement one! I've never done this one before.
- Where did you look?
    - We learned the logic of a radix sort by stepping through this on a whiteboard. resource: http://www.csharpstar.com/csharp-program-radix-sort/
- Did you write anything down, bookmark anything that looked useful?
    - We drew out an array and stepped through it step by step using the above resource to hammer down the basic logic.
- What did you use as a guideline or direction during the challenge?
  - We used the above resource to gain an understanding, then I jumped into VS to implement my own. My code is my own, minus the modulo logic.  The code from our external source is commented clearly in my solution.
