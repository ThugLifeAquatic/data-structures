# StudentSolution
- What did you learn?
    - I've written this method before, so I was confident in doing it again.  I initially forgot to add the final check on the last index, so my array was comming out only mostly sorted.  Brandon showed me what I was missing.
    - We were close in our logic with no help. We refined our solution using this Java example: http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quick-sort/
- Did you write anything down, bookmark anything that looked useful?
    - We drew a unsorted array and settled on the basic logic of swapping i and j when j encountered a value larger than the pivot. As mentioned above we forgot to go the last if statement in the partition method, and our Initial sort was only partially successful.
- What did you use as a guideline or direction during the challenge?
    - My experience with the data structure, my classmates, and the above link.
