- What did you learn?
    - Learned about the fibbonacci sequence.  I'd worked with it before but had forgotten it.
    - I came into this using just the problem domain.  My partners reaquainted me with the concept.
- Did you write anything down, bookmark anything that looked useful?
    - We whiteboarded it out and my partners and I aggreed on an implementation. I used the one we wrote together.
- What did you use as a guideline or direction during the challenge?
    - Just my experience and my partners.  Code provided was a team effort.  It's an unique, but imperfect solution.  We understand its flaws, but wanted to use our own code rather than use the classic solution.
