- What did you learn?
    - More practice with recursion. Break down the problem into its smallest form and repeat.
    - I came into this using just the problem domain.  No help or research used.
- Did you write anything down, bookmark anything that looked useful?
    - We whiteboarded it out and my partner and ID'd posibble sets. Then set to work on how to programatically build the recursive sets.
- What did you use as a guideline or direction during the challenge?
    - Just my experience.  Code written is 100% mine. It's a tad hackey but it works.
