# Solution.
- What did you learn? 
		- Remove methods in complex data structures are hard. There are a lot of edge cases and things to keep track of. I learned to work through a complex problem step-by-step, and to break it into smaller pieces.  I understand how BSTrees work, but there is a lot to consider when pruning one.
- Where did you look? 
		- We mostly brute forced it, talking through the problem with my partner set us up with a good problem domain. From there it was just working through each case step by step until we got everything covered.
- What notes did you use to help you successfully complete the challenge? 
		- Did you write anything down, bookmark anything that looked useful? 
      - We drew diagrams and pseudo coded out each case to come up with our final logic.
		- What did you use as a guideline or direction during the challenge?
      - Our Drawings and notes guided us through the challenge as we put our problem into code.
