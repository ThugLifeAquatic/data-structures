- What did you learn?
    -  I leared to more carefully review my variabl iniitalizations. I accidentally set my middle to (left-right + 1) instead of (right - left +1).  Index out of bounds exeptions for hours befor i finally found it.  This one was tough.  I dig my solution though, my final code is much tighter and more readable than any examples I found online.
- Where did you look?
    - We refined our solution using this resource:https://gist.github.com/pmgeorg/9122984
- Did you write anything down, bookmark anything that looked useful?
    - We drew out arrays and stepped through them step by step to hammer down the basic logic of recursively dividing the array into its smallest possible components.  This one was really hard to visualize due to its complex call stack, but I began to understand it more and more as we stepped through the algorithm.
- What did you use as a guideline or direction during the challenge?
    - My experience with the data structure, my classmates, and the above link.  The code from our external source is commented clearly in my solution.
