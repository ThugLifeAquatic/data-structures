- What did you learn?
    - How to rotate a matrix. 
    - I used a slight variation of the method I used to print the matrix.
- Did you write anything down, bookmark anything that looked useful?
    - We whiteboarded it out and settled on the logic for our solution.
- What did you use as a guideline or direction during the challenge?
    - Just my experience and my partners.  I was already familiar with the data structure.
