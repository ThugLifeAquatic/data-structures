- What did you learn?
    - Stepping through a recursive problem. 
    - I came into this using just the problem domain.  No help or research used.
- Did you write anything down, bookmark anything that looked useful?
    - We whiteboarded it out and ID'd the reocurring pattern. Having trouble implementing it though.  Having a hard time getting my algorithm to stop/adapt when needed.
- What did you use as a guideline or direction during the challenge?
    - Just my experience and my partners.  Code written is 100% mine.  Not working at the moment but the basic logic is there.
