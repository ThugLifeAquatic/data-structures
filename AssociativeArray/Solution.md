# StudentSolution
- What did you learn?
    - I've worked with hash tables in java, so I was confident in doing something similar in C#.
    - Wrote this from just reading the supplied article, and whiteboarding.  No code examples were used.  This solution is my own.
- Did you write anything down, bookmark anything that looked useful?
    - We drew whiteboarded it out and settled on the logic in my solution.  If the optimal index is occupied, find the nearest open one.  If the array is becoming to full, or the the location to add is beyond the end of the array, reallocate and add to the new, larger array.
- What did you use as a guideline or direction during the challenge?
    - My experience with the data structure, the supplied reading, my partner, and our whiteboard brainstorming.
