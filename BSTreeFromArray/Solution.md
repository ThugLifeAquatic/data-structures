- What did you learn?
    - I've written this method before, so I was confident in doing it again. I ran into trouble at the conditional statement in my 2nd for loop though.  I wrote everything except 1 Line of code using logic and my memory.  Great refreasher, I spent a couple of hours on it before I looked for help.  I got really close on my own
- Where did you look?
    - We were close in our logic with no help. We refined our solution using this resource: http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/blogs/insertion-sorting-algorithm-in-c-sharp1
- Did you write anything down, bookmark anything that looked useful?
    - We drew a unsorted array and settled on the basic logic of swapping at the index where we encountered an greater value.  We were a bit off though, and our code resulted in only a mostly sorted array.
- What did you use as a guideline or direction during the challenge?
    - My experience with the data structure, my classmates, and the above link.  The code line from our external source is commented clearly in my solution.
