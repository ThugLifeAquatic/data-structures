# StudentSolution
- What did you learn?
    - I've written this method before, so I was confident in doing it again.  This was a great refresher though.
- Where did you look?
    - We were close in our logic with no help. We refined our solution using this resource: http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorted-array-to-balanced-bst/
- Did you write anything down, bookmark anything that looked useful?
    - We drew a sorted array and determined the best way to balance the tree was by recursively dividing the array in half and adding the midpoint to the tree.
- What did you use as a guideline or direction during the challenge?
    - My experience with the data structure, my classmates, and the above link.
