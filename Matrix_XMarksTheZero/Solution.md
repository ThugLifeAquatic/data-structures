- What did you learn?
    - Multidemensional arrays were my jam before I learned OOP, I used them to store object like properties when I was learning javascript. Other than the slightly different syntax, I had no dificulty creating and manipulating them in C#.
    - I learned the synatax required to use matricies in C#.
- Did you write anything down, bookmark anything that looked useful?
    - We whiteboarded it out and settled on the logic in my solution. Because te requirements were kind of vague, we settled on triggering the x-like algorith on an addition of a zero, rather than the discovery of one.  Otherwise if multiople zero's were found the matrix would be quickly overwritten with only zeros.  There are ways around this of course, but to us, our meathod made the most sense.
- What did you use as a guideline or direction during the challenge?
    - Just my experience and my partners.  I was already familiar with the data structure.
